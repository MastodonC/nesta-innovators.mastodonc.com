          <h2>Data collection</h2>
          
          
          <p>This project used data about software developers from
          Github, StackOverflow, and Twitter.</p>
          
          <p>This data lets us understand the relative importance of
          different software developers to their communities, by
          looking at their relationships, activity levels, and other
          characteristics which are publicly shown on those sites.  We
          collected this data by making API calls over a long period
          to get a full set of user and repository profiles, which we
          could then filter down to those of interest to us (UK-based
          and popular). This is something of a needle in a haystack problem: we started with 3 million profiles, and eventually filtered this down to 3,000 key users, only 0.1% of the total.</p>
          
          <p>We also drew on Open Corporates’ data about corporate
          entities, to learn more about the companies where innovators
          worked.</p>
          

          <h2>Analysis method</h2>

          <p>Our final analysis was framed around the Github user
          profiles. We took the set of around 3000 UK-based users with
          over 10 followers each (i.e. in-degree of >10) as our starting
          point, our assumption being that having a number of peers
          following one’s work is an indicator of doing something
          interesting or innovative. We used these to create the
          counts of ‘innovators’ by city and company, and we analysed
          the number of repositories in each language for each of
          these users to create the heat map of popular languages by
          city.</p>
          

          <p>In order to create the network visualisations, we took
          the top 20 Github users by in-degree, and then found all of
          their reciprocal connections with in-degree >7, including those which sit
          outside the UK. The intention here is to discover how the
          social networks of innovators cross borders of company and
          city, and also to ensure that we picked up on any ‘hidden
          innovators’ who had more ordinary follower counts but who
          were followed and respected by the more visible members of
          the group, or who had not publicly stated their locations so
          would be missed in the initial sweep.</p>

          <p>We applied the Force Atlas algorithm to these
          sub-networks to create a clustered layout: we found that
          there was a high degree of interconnectedness in most
          programmers’ networks so there was limited separation into
          clusters, but that there were still enough interesting
          patterns to mean that network visualisations were useful and
          worthwhile.</p>

          <h2>Data collection and scrubbing challenges</h2>
          
          <p>In order to identify UK-only developers, for our ‘popular
          people’ list, we needed first to filter their Github
          profiles. Location in Github is a free text field, so it was
          necessary to parse many different location descriptions, and
          to identify and remove many false positives - for example,
          Cambridge Massachusetts, where MIT is based.</p>

          <p>We also found that the advertised API call limits were
          often incorrect, so had to adjust our approach a number of
          times to make sure that we could collect all of the relevant
          data.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, we found it much easier than expected
          to join the Github and Twitter data; almost all of the
          software developers on Github had also been Twitter early
          adopters and had used the same handle, so we could easily
          match these together by that unique identifier.</p>

          <p>We found that the same matching was true for
          StackOverflow users. However, we eventually found that the
          StackOverflow information added very little to our analysis,
          and made it more complex to understand, so we removed this
          from our source data.</p>

          <h2>Analytical challenges</h2>
          
          <p>We had two main analytical challenges: finding a
          reasonable definition of ‘innovator’; and figuring out a way
          to calculate and visualise social networks at a scale that
          was manageable.</p> 

          <p>For the ‘innovator’ definition, having tried a number of
          more complex approaches including network centrality
          calculations, StackOverflow scores, and other weighted
          measures, we eventually settled on a simple in-degree
          measure. This has the merit of being easy to explain, as
          well as conforming to an intuitive understanding of
          innovation, allowing the ‘collective intelligence’ of the
          network to determine who it thinks is innovative.</p> 

          <p>Visualising the social networks was much more
          difficult. We wanted to create visualisations that let the
          user explore a network by themselves, but also which
          provided some immediate insight into an innovator community
          by using clustering and colouring to indicate relationships
          and characteristics of the individuals. This proved
          extremely difficult: both clustering calculations and
          visualisation become impractical as soon as the network is
          of the order of thousands or tens of thousands of nodes, but
          providing only a single network of ‘top’ innovators gave
          very little insight.</p> 

          <p>Eventually we settled on creating a separate network for
          each of the ‘top’ innovators, taking all of their reciprocal
          connections with in-degree >7 and then the links between those
          connections. This gave us a set of manageably-sized networks
          with interestingly different characteristics and themes
          depending on the ‘seed’ person. It also ensured we picked up
          on other probable innovative individuals who didn’t have a
          huge in-degree or who hadn’t flagged themselves as in the
          UK, but who nonetheless were followed and respected by
          someone else with those characteristics.</p> 

          <h2>Assumptions and possible biases</h2>

          <p>The obvious bias of this analysis is that it relies on
          public profiles, and on users of Github only. The Github
          element should not be a significant problem, as it is a
          commonplace tool for software developers. However, the
          public data aspect, and the use of in-degree as a measure,
          means that it will inevitably miss people doing innovative
          work in isolation, or who are using Github but are not
          sharing their work with anyone else. These ‘hidden
          innovators’ will remain off the radar in any such public
          data tracking.</p>
          
          <p>In addition, we have relied only on people’s publicly
          declared locations and companies. This means that there are
          probably a number of individuals whose personal profiles are
          included here but who we haven’t been able to explicitly
          link to their employer.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, we will have some bias towards users of open
          source software, since GIthub is the de facto standard for
          open source code sharing. We don’t believe that this will be
          a major issue, since most developers even in corporate
          environments will make use of open source.</p> 

          <h2>Surprises</h2>

          <p>There are a number of surprises in this analysis, which
          should merit further analysis.</p> 

          <p>The first is how London-centric the innovator count
          is. This may be inevitable, given that strong communities
          may only grow stronger. However, we’d expected other towns
          to also show up in higher numbers.</p>

          <p>Also, the limited number of UK commercial companies in
          the data. There is a strong public sector presence: the BBC,
          GDS, and University of Cambridge are all in the top
          employers for innovative developers. There are also a number
          of US software companies.</p> 

          <p>Finally, the different network types that we see are also
          interesting: some innovators are immensely connected and
          tracking lots of other people, to the extent that their
          social graph is a hairball that’s very hard to parse, while some follow
          very little of others’ work.</p>
